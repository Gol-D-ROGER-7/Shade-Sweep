# Shade-Sweep ðŸš€

- This website has a special rectangle that changes color when you move your cursor. 
When you move your cursor to the left, the color of the rectangle turns red. The more you move your cursor to the left, the darker the red color becomes. On the other hand, when you move your cursor to the right, the rectangle's color changes to blue. 
It's a fun and interactive way to play with colors using your cursor!
